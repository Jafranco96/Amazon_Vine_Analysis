# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose

The startup BigMarket has been contracted by SellBy, a provider of a large catalogue of products, to help optimize their marketing efforts. Specifically, SellBy wants to analyze their product reviews from the Amazon Vine Program. In the Vine Program, members are provided with products and then are required to publish their reviews. The analysis goal is to determine if there is any positivity bias for the Amazon Vine reviews in comparison to the standard reviews.

The product type chosen for this analysis are Wireless products and an ETL process was performed to arrive to the desired findings.

## Analysis Results Summary

Comparing the percentage of 5-star reviews for Vine and non-Vine reviews, 36.25% and 47.01% respectively, no positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program can be determined.
To confirm this conclusion, an additional analysis where the original analysis is performed but an additional date parameter is included should be performed. For example, reviews only published in the last six months should be considered. This would ensure that the most recent data demonstrates the same positivity trends.
